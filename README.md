# JQuery plugin development template 
It's simple JQuery plugin development template using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)  toolkit along with [gulp-webserver](https://github.com/schickling/gulp-webserver) for development server. 
It also uses [Livereload](http://livereload.com/) for ... online livereload during development. 

I also added Visual Studio Code configuration:
* **task.json** - containing configuration for lauching *gulp* tasks from VS Code IDE
* **launch.json** - containing Chrome debug configuration

Those files can be found under **.vscode** folder in root directory
